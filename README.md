Hello world,

This app is intended to shed light on the cost of various healthcare operation throughout the continental US

Inspiration for this app comes from the good works of the folks at [ClearHealthCosts](https://clearhealthcosts.com)

The data for this app comes from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services(CMS) from the [CMS site](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/HealthCareConInit/Physician) and at the time the project was started(3/11/20) only 25 selected procudures offered by phyicians by state in 2012 are included

UI for app can be seen in this [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qkWDbTNGseHbkcjrPSd2tF/HealthCareCosts?node-id=0%3A1)

Logo for the app sourced from this article in [patient engagement hit](https://patientengagementhit.com/news/85-of-patients-concerned-about-healthcare-costs-quality) acutal [image url](https://patientengagementhit.com/images/site/article_headers/_normal/2018-healthcare-costs.jpg)

Dropdown functionality supported by Select from react-select shoutout to this [blog post](https://alligator.io/react/react-select/)

Data table visualized via [react-visualized](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized) for a basic list tutorial see this [react_virtualized_basics repo](https://github.com/browniefed/react_virtualized_basics/tree/basicList) with associated [tutorial video](https://codedaily.io/tutorials/123/Create-an-Auto-Resizing-Virtualized-List-with-react-virtualized)

To get a responsive grid I lifted from this [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/q3z3n2mkq9)

The table seen here is from the curtosy of the [material-table](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table) library
